This is a java project aimed to help grade school students with their math and science skills through games. This application was completed for IST 361: Application Development Design Studio II. The objective of this project is as follows: 

-Write an application development project proposal/pitch describing the project domain, focal problem space, design concept, design challenges, and basic competitive analysis.
-Develop a basic conceptual design to represent an application prototype including scenarios, use cases, and class diagram.
-Plan and estimate the effort required to develop an application prototype.
-Decompose an application development project into development phases or ‘sprints’.
-Implement a basic interactive prototype in Java using the model-view-controller architecture.
-Conduct and record application prototype demonstrations and walkthroughs.
-Conduct peer reviews of other students' designs and application prototypes.

This project is a amalgamation of techniques and knowledge of Java programming that I have obtained in my undergraduate studies in Information Science and Technology. The project was completed in 4 months and was broken down into 5 sprints.

Some functions that are worth highlighting:
  - Account information and persistent data is being read and written into a JSON file. 
  - Implementation of a trivia API https://opentdb.com/api_config.php for the science trivia game. 
  - UI and design was created with the user(grade school students) in mind. I tested the usability and function according to the feedback received by my niece and nephew. 
  - Application was created so that additional games and content can be added on easily.
